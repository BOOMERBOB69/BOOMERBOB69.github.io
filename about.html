			<p class = "para">The Morning Mission is a youth-run, officially registered non-profit organization in BC. Our teamâ€™s main goal is bridging the disconnection between the youth and the elderly through running connective and meaningful events, creating weekly educational posts, and reaching out to different elementary schools in hopes of collaboration. By allowing teens to connect with the elderly safely during these trying times, we are one step further in forming bonds and personal relationships between both demographics that will last a lifetime. Together, we can help our seniors stay connected and ingrained in our community. Let's take care of the elderly the way they took care of us when we were young.</p>
